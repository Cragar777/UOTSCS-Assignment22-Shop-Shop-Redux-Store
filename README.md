# UOTSCS-Assignment22-Shop-Shop-Redux-Store

**Description:**

This exercise was to refactor the existing e-commerce Shop-Shop application to change the global state management from React Context API to Redux. After reading the Redux documentation the React Context API GlobalState and associated variables were refactored to Redux code and a Redux store implemented. 

**User Story:**
```
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
```
**Acceptance Criteria:**
```
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
```
